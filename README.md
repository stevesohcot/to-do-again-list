## What is it?
An app to catalogue likeable items based on a topic.

Each item can have a 5-star rating, comments, and most importantly an indication of would you do this again?


## Why use it?
Personally, I'm using it to track food/drinks at a restaurant (pizza toppings, ice cream flavors, etc.)

But you can track anything: TV shows you like, wine brands to recommend, videogames to play again, etc.


## Tech Info
My first Progressive Web Application, built using Angular.  If installed to the homescreen, there's an icon, a loading screen, and the ability to work offline.  Uses an IndexedDb, which remains local to the browser.
